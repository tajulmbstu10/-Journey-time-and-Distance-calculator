In this project we have shown the notication service through which the user will get the information about railway station & also get the information about the train to catch the train.The user can identify their location & also identify their desired destination path.If the user only provide the starting & ending point from one railway staion to another, they will get the notification how times (minutes) are left to reach the station to cathch the train.<br><br>
The main purpose of this project is to provide an application which is user friendly and user can use the application anywhere in the world to find their location & also track the train using tracking device if possible without any difficulty. This will help the user who want to know their location & also want to know where the train is? In this application if we can use tracking device for tracking the train then it will be helpful for the user which will provide the user to know the speed of train,delays of train & exact location of the train.<br><br>
In this application using google map user can easily know the distance of their desired station & also be able in what time the train will reach the station.With the help of googlemaps with using Css ,Java Script,Html-5 & Jquery based application , the users current location can be identified appropriately.Collected information is then picked up and then sent to the server, station & train locations will be retrieved from the database to web page.
